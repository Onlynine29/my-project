# Number Guessing Game (Python)

A fun little game built with Python. The computer picks a random number between 1 and 50 â€” your job is to guess it. Simple? Yes. Easy? Not always.

##  How it works

- Choose your difficulty: `easy` (10 tries) or `hard` (5 tries)
- Guess a number between 1 and 50
- The game will tell you if you're too high or too low
- You win if you guess it right before you run out of attempts

##  Why it's useful (besides being fun)

This project helps you practice:
- Working with loops and conditionals
- Taking user input
- Using random numbers
- Writing clean error handling with `try`/`except`

##  How to run it

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine
2. Save the code in a file called `number_guess.py`
3. In your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python number_guess.py
